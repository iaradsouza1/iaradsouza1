# About me ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Hi! I'm Iara Souza and currently I'm a post-doc working at Harari Lab from the Ohio State University. I'm a biomedical scientist and a statistician, with a master's and a PhD in Bioinformatics, all of them earned from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. 

I'm passionate about programming in R and I love learning new things about this great programming language. Also, I'm passionate about Systems Biology and data integration from different "omics" as well as learning new statistical concepts.
