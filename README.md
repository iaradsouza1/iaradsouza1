# About me ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Hi! I'm Iara Souza and currently I'm a post-doc in Bioinformatics in the [Bioinformatics Multidisciplinary Environment](https://bioinfo.imd.ufrn.br/). I'm also a co-founder of the [Lexanomics](https://www.lexanomics.com/) startup. I'm a biomedical scientist and a statistician, with a master's and a PhD in Bioinformatics, all of them earned from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. 

I'm passionate about programming in R and I love learning new things about this great programming language. Also, I'm passionate about Systems Biology and data integration from different "omics" as well as learning new statistical concepts.
