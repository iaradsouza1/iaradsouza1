# About

Hi! I'm Iara Souza and currently I'm a post-doc in Bioinformatics in the [Bioinformatics Multidisciplinary Environment](https://bioinfo.imd.ufrn.br/). I'm also part of the bioinformatics consultancy team from the [Lexanomics](https://www.lexanomics.com/) startup. I'm a biomedical scientist and a statistician (almost there!), with a master's and a PhD in Bioinformatics, all of them earned from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. 

I'm passionate about programming in R and I love learning new things about this great programming language. Also, I'm passionate about Systems Biology and data integration from different "omics" as well as learning new statistical concepts.

During my bioinformatics/statistics formation, I cultivated the following abilities:

- I'm able to explore, clean, organize, visualize, and report data;
- I'm able to apply statistical methods and algorithms to data;
- I'm familiar with the current methods to analyze genomics and transcriptomics data;
- I'm able to develop new projects with emerging technologies in Biological Sciences.
